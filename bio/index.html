      <h2>Short Bio</h2>

      <p>Riad Djemili is the co-founder of Berlin indie game company Maschinen-Mensch. Their debut title The Curious Expedition, a game about fictitious expeditions set in the 19th century, was released in 2015 on Steam Early Access and won the German Developer award for “Best Indie Game 2015”.</p>
      <p>Riad started working in the game industry in 2005 and worked for seven years at Berlin game company YAGER, where he among other titles worked on the critically acclaimed game Spec Ops: The Line.</p>

      <h2>Long Bio</h2>

      <p>Riad Djemili co-founded the indie game company Maschinen-Mensch together with Johannes Kristmann in Berlin 2014. Prior to that he gained a master degree in computer science at the Freie Universität Berlin and worked for seven years as senior programmer at the second largest German AAA game developer YAGER, where he shipped the multi award-winning anti-war game “Spec Ops: The Line”.</p>
      <p>The debut game by Maschinen-Mensch is called "The Curious Expedition". In procedurally generated worlds the player takes on an expedition in the 19th century. Together with famous explorers and scientists like Charles Darwin or Marie Curie, he advances into uncharted regions, encounters untouched tribes and examines abandoned ruins.</p>
      <p>The game combines Riad’s interest in historical themes and fresh game mechanics. Critical examination of the dark side of the colonial era, such as racism and exploitation are also strong parts of the game. Riad sees computer games as an adult medium which can and should also deal with cultural issues.</p>
      <p>The game was released into Steam Early Access in May of 2015 and was nominated for multiple awards, including the two most renowned German video game prizes “Deutscher Computerspielepreis 2015” (nominated for best youth game) and “Deutscher Entwicklerpreis 2015” (winner of best German indie game category).</p>
      <p>The next game by Maschinen-Mensch will be called The Curious Case and is a generative crime story game set in the Roaring Twenties of Berlin. As a chief inspector of the homicide department, the player's goal is to solve numerous murder cases. For each procedurally generated case the game simulates the life stories and timelines of dozens of Berlin citizens and generates various degrees of relationships between them: families, classmates, business associates, jail companions and many others. In this web of the most varied milieus, an innovative story algorithm detects hooks for interesting story lines.</p>
      <p>Maschinen-Mensch wants to actively promote the development scene in Germany. In early 2015 they founded the first Berlin indie collective SAFTLADEN. Together with Studio Fizbin, BerlinGameScene.com and other independet developers they work in a shared office space founded in the heart of Berlins trendy Kreuzberg district. Their goal is to become the center of the independent developer scene in Germany.</p>
      <p>Maschinen-Mensch also collaborates with the Goethe-Institute on a world-wide game jam series encouraging game developers and artists to work on art games dealing with political topics. Riad was also part of two Game Mixer programs traveling and engaging with Indonesian and Brazilian game developers. He was also part of the Transatlantic Games Summit, showing German Indie Games at the PAX East show in 2017.</p>
